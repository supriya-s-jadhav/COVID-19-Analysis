This repository is fairly new and is still under development.

The COVID-Analysis repository is analysis of the ongoing Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and the affected cases. The analysis is done for learning and studying purposes. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to John Hopkins University for making the covid-19 time series dataset publicly available. Please checkout their [github page here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and their [excellent dashboard showcasing live cases globally](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). The links will also be made available in the reference section.
